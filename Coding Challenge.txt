3. what are the key things you would consider when creating/consuming an API to ensure that it is secure and reliable?

Answer:= At the time of creating/consuming an API to all the keys are =>
a) Input validation:= Validate all the user input to ensure that it is expected format.
b) Authentication and Authorization:= We have to implement proper authentication and autorization technique to confirm that only ifthe user is authorized the he or she can access those API.
c) Encryption:= Use the encryption technique to secure our data and showing the personal data.
d) Error handling:= We have to implement proper error handling technique that if the user provide some wrong input then it is able to show the proper error message to the user.
e) Testing:= We have to use this technique to the API to confirm that it works properly.

Instead of this above technique we have to use data privacy, API reliablity etc to confirm that our API is secure and reliable.
