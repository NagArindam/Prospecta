1. To trackle the above challenge =>
a) Read the CSV file into a data structure that can be manipulated very easily, we can consider as a list of dictionary.
b) Create a dictionary to store the values and formulas for each of the cell.
c) Iterate through each cell in the data structure and parse the value.
d) For each of the value, store it in the dictionary.
e) Write the results to a new CSV file.

2. Type of errors I would check for =>
a) Calculations errors:= Program should be able to handle all the errors in the formulas, we can say divide by zero errors.
b) Parsing errors:= Program should be able to handle errors in the CSV file that is missing values.
c) User input errors:=  Program should be able to handle errors that is caused by user inputs, we can say incorrect cell references.

3. To prevent the user from breaking our code =>
a) Error handling:= We have to implement error handling technique to provide some error messages to the user that will help the user for understatnding the errors.
b) Input validation:= We have to validate the input to confirm to the expected data types and format.
c) Documentation:= We have to provide clear documentation to proper guide to the user that how to use the program properly and expected input and output formats.
d) User interface:= We have to provide user friendly interface to guide the user that how to use the program properly and expected input and output formats.
